## Analysis of Covariance

If the experiment is well controlled and if it doesnâ€™t have any other
variable except one factor, we can explain the change of the dependent
variable by the one sample t-test or One-way ANOVA. However, we cannot
come up with this perfect situation especially in the field of economics
as a social science.

ANCOVA has numerical variables on top of ANOVA model. Ultimately, ANCOVA
has same purpose as ANOVA in the sense of comparing mean differences
among factors.

This dataset contains the result of three treatments from Anorexia
patients. The model is that shows the weight differences after
treatments but we know that the Post and Pre-weight have a storong
correlation. In other words, we can easily expect that the patient who
has a high weight has a high chance of a big weight loss after the
treatment. So, instead of ANOVA, we use the model
\(Post-weight = Pre-weight + Treat + \epsilon\).

``` r
library(multcomp)
anorexia=read.csv("data/anorexia.csv")
attach(anorexia)
Treat=relevel(Treat, ref="Cont") # Change Cont as the reference group.
# levels(Treat) = c("Count","CBT", "FT") also possible

out=lm(Postwt ~ Prewt + Treat, data=anorexia)
anova(out)
```

From the ANOVA p-value=0.0008438 above, we can conclude that the
treatments have significant effect of the weight loss. In addition, from
the regression result, all the p-values are significant. However, we
cannot conclude which treatment has the better impact on the weight
loss.

To verify the impact differences among the treatments, we are going to
use the Tukey method.

dunn=glht(out, linfct=mcp(Treat = "Tukey"))

The result suggest each different method is significant in 10% level.
Especially, the difference between FT and Cont is 0.1% level.
