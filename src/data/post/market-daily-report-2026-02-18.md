## Currency Market

### USD/KRW Exchange Rate

| Pair | Rate | Direction |
|------|------|-----------|
| **USD/KRW** | 1,448.96 | Dollar Strengthening |

**Analysis:**
- The won weakened to 1,448.96 per dollar

- Watch 1,450 psychological resistance level

**Impact on Korean Stocks:**
- Positive for exporters: Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, Hyundai Motor
- Weaker won improves overseas earnings when repatriated
- May offset some domestic demand weakness

**Market Implications:**
- Current yield levels continue to support selective equity valuations
- Tech stocks sensitive to rate environment remain under scrutiny
- Fixed income provides competition for equity allocations

2. **Semiconductor Volatility:** Divergent trends suggest sector uncertainty
3. **Currency Pressure:** Won weakness could accelerate if dollar strengthens further
4. **Geopolitical:** Ongoing monitoring of East Asian regional dynamics

4. **KOSDAQ Momentum:** Strong 1.77% gain suggests growth stock appetite

---

## Market Outlook

### Short-term (1-5 days)
- **US Markets:** Consolidation likely after recent gains; watch 6,850 support on S&P 500
- **Korean Markets:** KOSPI range-bound 5,400-5,550; exporters to outperform
- **Semiconductors:** Volatility to persist; monitor NVIDIA $180 and Samsung 180K levels

### Medium-term (1-4 weeks)
- Earnings season conclusions will drive next directional move
- Fed policy expectations remain market-moving catalyst
- Korean won trajectory critical for export-heavy KOSPI

### Technical Levels to Watch

## Trading Volume Analysis

### High Volume Alerts
- **Samsung Electronics:** 33.4M shares - 2x average volume suggests institutional activity

- **SK Hynix:** 3.4M shares - healthy liquidity

**Interpretation:** Samsung's exceptional volume on an up day is bullish, suggesting accumulation rather than distribution.

## Conclusion

February 18, 2026, delivered a constructive session for both US and Korean markets, though underlying currents suggest selectivity is key. The divergence between Amazon's strength and Microsoft's weakness, alongside NVIDIA's decline, indicates sector rotation rather than broad risk-off behavior.

Korean markets benefited from currency dynamics and Samsung's strong performance, though concerns about SK Hynix and Hyundai Motor warrant attention. The KOSDAQ's outperformance signals healthy risk appetite for Korean growth stocks.

**Key Takeaways:**
1. US market breadth remains positive but watch for consolidation
2. Korean exporters positioned well with current USD/KRW levels
3. Semiconductor sector requires selective approach
4. Monitor treasury yields for equity valuation implications

**Investor Action Items:**
- Review semiconductor holdings for rebalancing opportunities
- Consider Korean exporter exposure given currency tailwinds
- Watch for NVIDIA support test at $180 for potential entry
- Monitor Samsung momentum for continuation above 181,000 KRW
