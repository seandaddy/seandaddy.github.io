## Executive Summary

Global markets displayed mixed performance on February 13, 2026, with U.S. indices showing resilience despite technology sector weakness. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones posted marginal gains (+0.05% and +0.10% respectively), while the NASDAQ dipped -0.22% on profit-taking in megacap tech stocks. Korean markets faced headwinds with the KOSPI declining -0.28%, though major technology stocks like Samsung and SK Hynix demonstrated strength. Treasury yields declined across the curve, signaling continued investor caution. The VIX dropped -1.06% to 20.6, suggesting moderating near-term volatility expectations.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Magnificent 7 under pressure**: 6 of 7 declined, with Apple (-2.27%) and NVIDIA (-2.21%) leading losses
- **Korean tech resilience**: Samsung and SK Hynix posted solid gains despite broader market weakness
- **Bond yields retreat**: 10-year Treasury fell to 4.056%, indicating flight-to-quality flows
- **USD strength**: Dollar remained robust at 1,439.05 KRW/USD

## Market Indices

| Index | Level | Change | % Change |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|
| **S&P 500** | 6,836.17 | +3.41 | +0.05% |
| **Dow Jones Industrial** | 49,500.93 | +48.95 | +0.10% |
| **NASDAQ Composite** | 22,546.67 | -50.48 | -0.22% |
| **KOSPI** | 5,507.01 | -15.26 | -0.28% |
| **VIX (Volatility Index)** | 20.6 | -0.22 | -1.06% |

### Analysis
The divergence between the Dow Jones and NASDAQ reflects sector rotation away from high-valuation technology stocks toward value and cyclical names. The S&P 500's modest gain masks internal weakness, with breadth likely negative given tech sector underperformance. The KOSPI's decline aligns with regional weakness, though domestic semiconductor names bucked the trend.

## U.S. Equities: Magnificent 7

| Company | Ticker | Price (USD) | Change | % Change | Market Cap Signal |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **Apple** | AAPL | $255.78 | -$5.95 | -2.27% | 🔴 Weakness |
| **Microsoft** | MSFT | $401.32 | -$0.52 | -0.13% | 🟡 Flat |
| **Alphabet** | GOOGL | $305.72 | -$3.28 | -1.06% | 🔴 Moderate Decline |
| **Amazon** | AMZN | $198.79 | -$0.81 | -0.41% | 🟡 Slight Weakness |
| **NVIDIA** | NVDA | $182.81 | -$4.13 | -2.21% | 🔴 Weakness |
| **Meta Platforms** | META | $639.77 | -$10.04 | -1.55% | 🔴 Moderate Decline |
| **Tesla** | TSLA | $417.44 | +$0.37 | +0.09% | 🟢 Only Gainer |

### Sector Insights
**Technology Selloff**: The Magnificent 7's collective decline of ~1.3% (weighted average) represents $180+ billion in market cap erosion. Apple's 2.27% drop is particularly notable given recent product cycle optimism. NVIDIA's weakness may reflect profit-taking after an extraordinary 2025 run, or concerns about AI capex sustainability.

**Tesla's Divergence**: As the sole gainer, Tesla's +0.09% performance suggests either autonomous vehicle optimism or portfolio rebalancing. Its relative strength warrants monitoring for potential sector leadership shift.

**Risk Factors**: Valuation compression in megacap tech could signal broader multiple reset if treasury yields rise further or earnings disappoint. Current P/E ratios remain elevated versus historical averages.

## Korean Equities

| Company | Code | Price (KRW) | Change | Sector | Trend |
|---------|------|-------------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Samsung Electronics** | 005930 | ₩181,200 | +₩2,600 | Semiconductors | 🟢 +1.46% |
| **SK Hynix** | 000660 | ₩880,000 | +₩8,000 | Semiconductors | 🟢 +0.92% |
| **Hyundai Motor** | 005380 | ₩499,000 | +₩7,000 | Automotive | 🟢 +1.42% |

### Analysis
**Semiconductor Strength**: Despite NVIDIA's U.S. decline, Korean chip giants rallied on strong memory demand fundamentals. Samsung's ₩181,200 level represents a key technical breakout, while SK Hynix's gains reflect HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) market dominance.

**Hyundai's Momentum**: The automotive sector showed resilience with Hyundai's +1.42% gain, likely driven by EV sales momentum and strong Q4 earnings outlook.

**Valuation Perspective**: At current levels, Samsung trades at ~12x forward P/E versus NVIDIA's ~35x, suggesting relative value opportunity for semiconductor exposure.

## Foreign Exchange

| Pair | Rate | Trend |
|------|------|-------|
| **USD/KRW** | 1,439.05 | 🔴 Strong Dollar |

### Analysis
The Korean won weakened slightly against the dollar, hovering near the 1,440 psychological level. This reflects broad dollar strength amid U.S. economic resilience and Fed rate policy expectations. For Korean exporters like Samsung and Hyundai, a weaker won provides earnings tailwinds, though it increases import costs.

**Key Levels to Watch:**
- Resistance: 1,450 (significant psychological barrier)
- Support: 1,420 (short-term technical floor)

## Fixed Income: U.S. Treasury Yields

| Maturity | Yield | Change (bps) | Interpretation |
|----------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **2-Year** | 3.593% | -0.5 | Near-term rate cut expectations |
| **10-Year** | 4.056% | -4.8 | Flight to safety / dovish repricing |
| **30-Year** | 4.698% | -3.3 | Long-term inflation expectations moderate |

### Yield Curve Analysis
The 10-year yield's 4.8 basis point decline to 4.056% is significant, marking the lowest level in three weeks. The 2s10s spread steepened marginally to 46.3 basis points, suggesting markets are pricing in eventual Fed easing without immediate recession fears.

**Fixed Income Outlook:**
- **Bull steepening pattern**: Short-end stability with long-end rallies indicates growth concerns without crisis
- **4.00% magnet**: If 10-year breaks below 4.00%, could trigger technical buying and further equity volatility
- **Real yields**: With inflation running ~2.5%, real 10-year yield of ~1.55% remains attractive versus equities

---

## Risk Factors & Market Outlook

### Immediate Risks (1-Week Horizon)
1. **Tech Earnings Volatility**: Upcoming Magnificent 7 earnings could amplify selloff if guidance disappoints
2. **Fed Communications**: Any FOMC minutes or Fed speaker comments on rate path could trigger yield spikes
3. **Geopolitical Watch**: Ongoing trade policy uncertainty and China-Taiwan tensions remain tail risks
4. **4,000 Support**: If 10-year yield breaks below 4.00%, could signal risk-off acceleration

### Medium-Term Considerations (1-3 Months)
1. **Valuation Reset**: Tech sector trading at 28x forward P/E versus S&P 500 at 21x creates vulnerability
2. **Earnings Season**: Q4 2025 results will test whether AI monetization justifies current valuations
3. **Seasonal Patterns**: February-March historically choppy; watch for tax-loss harvesting end effects
4. **Korea Premium**: Korean equities trade at 30% discount to U.S. on P/E basis—potential catch-up trade

### Opportunities
- **Yield Plays**: 10-year Treasuries at 4.056% offer compelling risk-adjusted returns
- **Korean Tech**: Samsung/SK Hynix provide semiconductor exposure at fraction of U.S. valuations
- **Defensive Positioning**: Consumer staples and utilities may outperform if growth concerns mount
- **Volatility Selling**: VIX at 20.6 (elevated but declining) creates premium selling opportunities

## Conclusion

February 13, 2026 reflected a market in transition—U.S. indices consolidating at elevated levels while technology leadership shows cracks. The decline in treasury yields and VIX suggests investors are hedging rather than panicking, but the Magnificent 7's weakness bears close monitoring given their outsize index impact.

**Key Themes:**
1. **Rotation over Capitulation**: Sector rotation, not broad selloff
2. **Korea Resilience**: Semiconductor fundamentals remain strong
3. **Yield Magnet**: 10-year Treasury approaching critical 4.00% level
4. **Volatility Complacency**: VIX at 20.6 may underestimate event risks

**Actionable Insights:**
- Use tech weakness to accumulate quality names at better valuations
- Korean equities offer value alternative to pricey U.S. tech
- Treasuries provide ballast; consider locking in 4%+ yields
- Monitor CPI (Feb 14) for potential volatility catalyst

*Markets remain range-bound with defensive undertones. Discipline, diversification, and data-driven decision making remain paramount.*
