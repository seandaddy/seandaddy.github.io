## 📈 MAJOR INDICES - WEEKLY PERFORMANCE

### US Indices

| Index | Week Start | Week End | Change | % Change | YTD 2026 |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|----------|----------|
| **S&P 500** | 6,833.61 | 6,899.88 | +66.27 | **+0.97%** | +1.97% |
| **Dow Jones** | 49,121.94 | 49,859.37 | +737.43 | **+0.67%** | +2.67% |

| **Russell 2000** | 2,605.65 | 2,618.85 | +13.20 | **+0.51%** | +1.51% |

**Analysis:**
Broad market indices held up remarkably well despite Magnificent 7 weakness, demonstrating healthy market breadth. The Dow's outperformance (+0.67% vs Nasdaq +0.64%) signals rotation into value/industrials. Small caps (Russell 2000) also showed resilience.

### Korean Indices

| Index | Week Start | Week End | Change | % Change | Notes |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| **KOSPI** | 5,371.10 | 5,089.14 | -281.96 | **-5.25%** | Worst week of 2026 |
| **KOSDAQ** | ~1,109 | 1,080.77 | ~-28 | **~-2.5%** | Tech-heavy index weak |

**Analysis:**
Korean markets suffered their worst week of 2026, driven by:
- Wednesday's -3.86% single-day plunge
- Semiconductor sector collapse after Monday's rally
- Global tech weakness spillover
- Foreign investor outflows

---

## 💱 CURRENCY & COMMODITIES

### Currency Markets

**USD/KRW:**
- **Week Start:** ~1,459
- **Week End:** 1,462.97
- **Change:** +~4 won (0.27% won weakness)

**Analysis:** Korean won showed modest weakness despite domestic market turmoil. The relatively stable FX environment suggests controlled capital flows and Bank of Korea intervention efficacy.

### Commodities (Notable Moves)

| Commodity | Weekly Change | Price | Trend |
|-----------|--------------|-------|-------|
| **Gold** | +1.76% (Thursday) | $4,947.20 | ↑ Approaching $5,000 |
| **Brent Crude** | +1.36% (Thursday) | $68.47 | ↑ Stable demand |
| **Copper** | +0.59% (Thursday) | $1,235.20 | ↑ Industrial strength |

**Analysis:** Gold's rally to nearly $5,000/oz alongside equity gains is unusual, suggesting hedging demand and inflation concerns persist despite market optimism.

---

## 🔍 WEEKLY THEMES & ANALYSIS

### Theme 1: AI Investment Fatigue

**The Trigger:** Alphabet's $180 billion AI capital expenditure announcement

**Investor Concerns:**
- Near-term profitability impact (margin compression)
- ROI timeline unclear (when will spending translate to revenue?)
- Competitive dynamics (arms race forcing all tech giants to spend)
- Valuation risk (elevated multiples amid rising capex)

**Market Impact:**
- Alphabet -3.62% for the week
- Microsoft -4.62% (compounded by downgrade)
- Amazon -6.05% (AWS margin concerns)
- Broader tech sector revaluation

**Bottom Line:** The market is questioning whether massive AI infrastructure spending will deliver proportional returns. Near-term, this creates volatility. Long-term, the AI secular growth story remains intact.

---

### Theme 2: Magnificent 7 Underperformance = Healthy Rotation

**The Divergence:**
- Broad indices: +0.6% to +1.0%
- Mag 7 average: -3.3% (excluding AAPL)
- Small caps, value stocks, industrials outperforming

**Why This Matters:**
Market leadership broadening beyond mega-cap tech is a **positive development** for bull market sustainability. Concentration risk was extreme (Mag 7 = ~30% of S&P 500 market cap).

**Rotation Beneficiaries:**
- Financials (higher yields supportive)
- Industrials (Dow strength)
- Energy & Materials (YTD leaders)
- International stocks (EEM +8% YTD, outpacing US)

**Strategic Implication:** Diversification becoming more important. "Barbell strategy" of holding quality Mag 7 (AAPL, NVDA) + exposure to rotation beneficiaries makes sense.

---

### Theme 3: Korean Market Oversold

**The Volatility:**
- Monday: +9% to +11% (euphoria)
- Week: -5% to -7.5% (despair)
- Net: Severe whipsaw, emotional extremes

**Fundamental Disconnect:**
Despite week's carnage, **AI chip demand fundamentals remain strong:**
- Data center buildout accelerating globally
- High-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand robust
- Samsung/SK Hynix maintain technology leadership
- Memory chip pricing power improving (inventory normalization)

**Valuation Opportunity:**
- Korean stocks trade at discount to US peers (KOSPI P/E vs S&P 500)
- -5% to -7.5% weekly declines appear excessive
- Tactical buying opportunity for long-term investors
- Risk: Global tech sentiment must stabilize first

---

### Theme 4: Apple = Tech Safe Haven

**The Only Winner:**
Apple +2.59% while peers fell -3.6% to -6.8%

**Why Apple Outperformed:**
1. **Post-earnings momentum** - Strong Q1 results sustained
2. **Defensive characteristics** - Consumer staple-like stability
3. **Product cycle strength** - AI features driving iPhone demand
4. **Dividend appeal** - Ex-dividend Feb 9 attracts income investors
5. **Quality flight** - Investors rotating to highest-quality names

**Strategic Role:** In turbulent tech markets, AAPL demonstrates why "quality at reasonable price" works. While not immune to sector weakness, it holds up far better than growth peers.

---

### Theme 5: Volatility Spike = Caution Warranted

**VIX Behavior:**
- Tuesday: +7.17% to 19.29
- Wednesday: +11.13% to 20.71
- Sustained above 20 = elevated risk

**What This Means:**
- Near-term choppiness expected
- Institutional hedging activity increasing
- Options market pricing higher uncertainty
- Rotation/rebalancing flows creating swings

**Investor Response:**
- Avoid panic selling (volatility ≠ disaster)
- Use volatility to scale into quality positions
- Maintain discipline on position sizing
- Keep cash reserves for better entry points

---

## ⚠️ RISK FACTORS

### 1. Tech Sector Valuation Risk
- **Mag 7 P/E ratios** remain elevated despite pullback
- **AI spending** creating margin pressure near-term

### 4. Geopolitical Tensions
- **US-China trade** - technology restrictions ongoing
- **Korea-China relations** - EV competition intensifying

### 5. Market Breadth Deterioration Risk
- **VIX above 20** - elevated volatility persisting
- **Sector leadership** - rotation could reverse quickly
- **Small cap weakness** - Russell 2000 lagging despite week's gain
- **Credit markets** - watch for spread widening

---

---

### Key Question: Correction or Something Worse?

**Our View:** This is a **healthy correction** within an ongoing bull market.

**Evidence Supporting Bull Case:**
- Economic fundamentals strong (earnings +11%, AI demand robust)
- Broad market breadth improving (rotation = maturation, not panic)
- Valuation reset creating better entry points
- VIX spike likely marks near-term bottom (if history repeats)

**What Would Change Our View:**
- KOSPI breaking 5,000 support decisively
- S&P 500 breaking below 6,800 on high volume
- Fed turning unexpectedly hawkish (Warsh hearings)
- Earnings season showing widespread margin compression
