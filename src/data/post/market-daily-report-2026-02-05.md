## 💱 Currency Markets

### USD/KRW Exchange Rate

**1 USD = 1,463.40 KRW**  
Change: Relatively stable (slight won weakness)

The Korean won remained relatively stable against the dollar despite domestic market turbulence. The Bank of Korea's monetary policy stance and stable trade balance provided support. The won has been trading in a narrow range of 1,450-1,480 per dollar over the past week.

**Implications:**

- Exporters (Samsung, Hyundai): Neutral to slightly positive pricing competitiveness
- Importers: Stable input costs
- Foreign investors: Currency risk remains manageable

## 📈 Bond Markets & Interest Rates

### US Treasury Yields

(Note: Exact current yields unavailable, using recent data trends)

| Maturity    | Estimated Yield | Direction                      |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **2-Year**  | ~4.15%          | ↑ Slight uptick                |
| **10-Year** | ~4.28%          | ↑ Rising on inflation concerns |
| **30-Year** | ~4.52%          | ↑ Long-end under pressure      |

**Analysis:**

- Treasury yields edged higher as risk-off sentiment favored quality bonds less than typical, possibly indicating inflation concerns outweighing growth fears
- Fed Chair nomination of Kevin Warsh by President Trump adds uncertainty to monetary policy outlook
- Next FOMC meeting: March 18, 2026 (only 16% odds of 25bp cut priced in)

### Korean Government Bonds

- **3-Year KTB:** Yield likely moved higher following KOSPI decline
- **10-Year KTB:** Expected to track global bond market moves
- Bank of Korea maintaining cautious stance on policy rates

## 🎯 Sector Analysis

### Technology Sector: Under Heavy Pressure

**Key Theme:** **AI Investment Fatigue**

The technology sector faced its worst day in weeks as investors questioned the massive capital expenditures being committed to AI infrastructure without clear near-term revenue visibility. Alphabet's $180 billion spending announcement was the catalyst, but concerns extend across the industry.

**Winners:**

- **Semiconductors (mixed):** NVDA up, but memory chip makers down globally
- **AI Infrastructure:** Data center plays holding better than software

**Losers:**

- **Cloud Services:** MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN all under pressure
- **Memory Chips:** Samsung, SK Hynix suffered steep declines
- **Software:** Broad weakness on competitive AI concerns

### Automotive Sector: EV Competition Intensifies

Tesla's modest decline and Hyundai's -3% drop reflect growing concerns about Chinese EV manufacturers, particularly BYD, expanding globally. Legacy automakers and EV pure-plays face margin pressure from intense competition.

### Financial Sector: Defensive Positioning

Banks and financials showed relative resilience as investors positioned for potential Fed policy uncertainty with Kevin Warsh's nomination as Fed Chair.

---

## ⚠️ Risk Factors & Concerns

### 1. **Valuation Concerns in Tech**

- **Magnificent 7 P/E ratios** remain elevated: NVDA at 43.25x, TSLA at 361.35x
- **AI spending surge** without proportional revenue growth raises sustainability questions
- **Rotation risk:** Money may flow from growth to value if sentiment shifts further

### 2. **Fed Policy Uncertainty**

- **Kevin Warsh nomination** as Fed Chair creates uncertainty about policy direction
- Warsh is known as a policy hawk, potentially signaling tighter monetary conditions
- Congressional hearings will be closely watched for policy hints
- Current Fed Chair Jerome Powell steps down in May 2026

### 3. **Geopolitical Tensions**

- **US-China trade relations:** Ongoing technology restrictions and tariff concerns
- **Korea-China relations:** Chinese EV competition threatens Korean automakers
- **Middle East tensions:** Oil price volatility potential

### 4. **Earnings Season Pressure**

- **Mixed results** from tech giants creating volatility
- **Guidance matters more than beats:** Amazon earnings today will be crucial test
- **Margin compression** concerns across multiple sectors

### 5. **Technical Breakdown Risks**

- **VIX surge** to 20.71 (+11.13%) signals rising fear
- **KOSPI broke key support** at 5,200; next support at 5,000
- **S&P 500 near-term support** at 6,800; break could accelerate selling

---

## 🔮 Market Outlook & Strategic Considerations

### Near-Term (1-2 Weeks)

**Bias:** **Cautious/Neutral**

- **Volatility expected to remain elevated** as investors digest Alphabet's spending plans and Microsoft's downgrade
- **Amazon earnings today (Feb 5)** will be critical: AWS growth and retail margins in focus
- **Key support levels must hold:** KOSPI 5,000 / S&P 500 6,800
- **Rotation potential:** Watch for money flowing from Magnificent 7 to other sectors
- **VIX above 20** suggests continued choppiness ahead

### Medium-Term (1-3 Months)

**Bias:** **Neutral to Cautiously Positive**

- **Fed clarity needed:** Kevin Warsh's Congressional hearings (timing TBA) will be market-moving events
- **AI investment thesis resilient** but timing of returns matters; near-term multiple compression possible
- **Earnings visibility:** Q1 2026 guidance will determine whether current weakness is buying opportunity
- **Korean markets oversold:** KOSPI's -3.86% decline may present entry points if global sentiment stabilizes
- **Sector rotation opportunity:** Defensive sectors, small-caps, and international stocks may outperform

### Long-Term (3-12 Months)

**Bias:** **Constructive**

- **AI secular growth intact:** Despite near-term volatility, multi-year AI infrastructure buildout continues
- **Semiconductor demand robust:** NVDA, Samsung, SK Hynix benefit from data center GPU and HBM demand
- **Corporate profitability healthy:** Earnings growth continues despite margin pressures
- **Valuation reset healthy:** Corrections create better entry points for quality names
- **Korean stocks attractive:** Trading at discounts to US peers; strong tech exposure

### Investment Strategy Recommendations

**For Conservative Investors:**

1. **Raise cash levels** to 10-15% to take advantage of potential further weakness
2. **Favor dividend aristocrats** and defensive sectors (Consumer Staples, Healthcare, Utilities)
3. **Bond allocation:** Consider locking in 4%+ yields on high-quality bonds
4. **Avoid leveraged positions** until volatility subsides

**For Growth Investors:**

1. **Don't panic-sell quality names:** AAPL, NVDA, META showing relative strength
2. **Watch for capitulation signals:** VIX spike above 25 could mark near-term bottom
3. **Dollar-cost average** into weakness rather than lump-sum deployment
4. **Sector diversification:** Don't over-concentrate in Magnificent 7

**For Korean Market Investors:**

1. **Samsung, SK Hynix oversold:** -5.80% and -6.44% declines may be overdone given strong AI chip demand
2. **Defensive rotation:** Consider Korean financials and consumer staples
3. **Currency hedge consideration:** Won stability is positive but monitor BOK policy
4. **Valuation opportunity:** KOSPI P/E discount to S&P 500 widening

**Key Stocks to Watch:**

- **Buy on weakness:** NVDA, META, Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix
- **Hold for now:** AAPL, MSFT (wait for stabilization)
- **Caution warranted:** GOOGL (spending concerns), AMZN (await earnings), TSLA (valuation stretched)

## 🎓 Bottom Line

February 5, 2026 marked a significant risk-off session, particularly for Korean markets where the KOSPI plunged -3.86% amid heavy tech stock selling. US markets fared better but still declined as Alphabet's massive AI spending commitment and Microsoft's downgrade rattled investor confidence in technology valuations.

**The key question: Is this a healthy correction or the start of something worse?**

**Our view:** This appears to be a **healthy correction** within an ongoing bull market. The AI secular theme remains intact, corporate earnings are solid, and economic fundamentals are supportive. However, near-term volatility is warranted given stretched valuations and AI investment fatigue.

**Action plan:**

1. **Use weakness selectively** to add to quality positions
2. **Maintain discipline** on valuations and position sizing
3. **Stay diversified** across sectors and geographies
4. **Keep cash reserves** for better entry points if selling accelerates

**Korean market-specific:** The -3.86% KOSPI decline looks overdone given strong semiconductor fundamentals. Samsung and SK Hynix remain core AI infrastructure plays with attractive valuations post-selloff.

**US market-specific:** Magnificent 7 leadership is being questioned, but NVDA and META's outperformance shows investor differentiation. The market is becoming more selective, which is a healthy sign of maturation.
