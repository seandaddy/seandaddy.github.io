## Conclusion

February 12, 2026 marked a historic day for Korean markets with the KOSPI breaking above 5,500 for the first time, driven by semiconductor strength and robust institutional/foreign buying. In contrast, US markets experienced significant selling pressure, particularly in mega-cap technology stocks, as concerns about AI disruption, regulatory pressures, and valuation compression weighed on sentiment.

The divergence between these two major markets highlights shifting global capital flows and sector leadership. Korean semiconductors remain well-positioned to benefit from sustained AI infrastructure demand, while US tech giants face a period of consolidation and revaluation.

Investors should monitor the sustainability of Korean market strength, the depth of US tech correction, and evolving Fed policy dynamics. The current environment favors selective positioning, increased diversification, and maintaining flexibility to capitalize on emerging opportunities.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Korean semiconductors** leading global equity strength - historic KOSPI highs
2. **US Magnificent 7** under significant pressure - valuation and regulatory concerns
3. **Sector rotation** accelerating from growth to value/cyclicals
4. **Defensive positioning** warranted near-term; opportunities emerging in bonds and value sectors
