- **Analyst Target:** $253.62 (avg.) | High: $352.00

**Performance Metrics:**

- Profit Margin: 53.01%
- Return on Equity: 107.36%
- Q3 FY26 Revenue: $57.01B
- Q3 Earnings: $31.77B

**Analysis:** NVIDIA continues to dominate the AI infrastructure market, with strong momentum into the company's February 25 earnings report. The 3.24% gain reflects investor confidence in accelerated computing demand. With a forward P/E of 24.10 (nearly half the trailing P/E), the market is pricing in robust earnings growth. The stock remains a core AI beneficiary with unparalleled GPU leadership.

#### 🟢 **Microsoft (MSFT)** - Cloud & AI Leader

- **Current:** $412.05 (+2.72%)
- **52-Week Range:** $344.79 - $555.45
- **P/E Ratio:** 25.80 | **Forward P/E:** 24.27
- **YTD Return:** +14.80%

**Performance Metrics:**

- Profit Margin: 39.04%
- Q2 FY26 Revenue: $81.27B (+17% YoY)
- Market Cap: $3.06T
- Dividend Yield: 0.91%

**Analysis:** Microsoft's 2.72% gain comes despite being down 27% from its 2025 peak. The company's Q2 revenue growth of 17% demonstrates resilience in cloud (Azure) and productivity segments. AI monetization through Copilot and Azure AI services is accelerating. The stock offers attractive value at 25.80x earnings with strong cash flow generation ($53.64B levered FCF).

#### 🟢 **Meta Platforms (META)** - Social & AI Innovation

- **Current:** $679.35 (+2.70%)
- **52-Week Range:** $479.80 - $796.25
- **P/E Ratio:** 28.93 | **Forward P/E:** 21.98
- **Profit Margin:** 30.08%

**Analysis:** Meta rallied 2.70% as investors digest strong Q4 results and AI-driven engagement growth. With 4 billion monthly active users across its Family of Apps, Meta maintains unparalleled social media reach. Reality Labs investments continue, though the core advertising business (63% international revenue) drives profitability. Forward P/E of 21.98 suggests continued earnings expansion.

#### 🟡 **Tesla (TSLA)** - Mixed Signals

- **Current:** $418.29 (+1.75%)
- **P/E Ratio:** 390.93 (elevated)
- **Q4 FY25 Deliveries:** 1.64M vehicles
- **Profit Margin:** 4.00%

**Analysis:** Tesla gained 1.75% amid speculation about potential SpaceX merger and robotics expansion. However, the extreme P/E of 390.93 reflects valuation premium on future autonomy and energy businesses rather than current auto operations. Q4 profit declined 17% YoY, signaling margin pressure. The stock trades on long-term optionality (robotaxis, humanoid robots, energy storage).

#### 🟡 **Amazon (AMZN)** - Marginal Gain

- **Current:** $210.88 (+0.27%)
- **Q4 FY25 Revenue:** $213.39B
- **P/E Ratio:** 29.41 | **Forward P/E:** 25.45
- **AWS Leadership:** Cloud infrastructure dominance

**Analysis:** Amazon's modest 0.27% gain reflects mixed investor sentiment. While AWS continues to lead cloud infrastructure with AI integration, retail margins face pressure. The company's $200B projected 2026 capex signals aggressive AI infrastructure investment, though this weighs on near-term profitability.

#### 🔴 **Apple (AAPL)** - Pullback

- **Current:** $272.06 (-2.09%)
- **52-Week Range:** $169.21 - $288.62
- **P/E Ratio:** 34.44
- **Market Cap:** $4.00T

**Analysis:** Apple declined 2.09% despite being ex-dividend today. The pullback may reflect profit-taking after strong 2025 performance (+20.06% 1-year return). Upcoming iPhone 17e launch and Mac refreshes position the company well, but Services growth deceleration and China risks remain concerns. YTD return of +0.07% lags the market.

#### 🔴 **Alphabet (GOOGL)** - Largest Decliner

- **Current:** $322.86 (-2.53%)
- **Q4 FY25 Revenue:** $113.83B
- **Capex Guidance:** $175-185B for 2026
- **P/E Ratio:** 29.84 | **Forward P/E:** 29.50

**Analysis:** Alphabet fell 2.53%, the largest Mag 7 decliner, as investors digest massive AI capex plans ($175-185B in 2026). While Google Cloud showed strength and search advertising remained resilient, the market questions near-term ROI on AI infrastructure spending. European antitrust concerns around WhatsApp add regulatory risk. Despite the pullback, the stock has delivered +69.17% over the past year.

## IV. Foreign Exchange & Commodities

### USD/KRW Exchange Rate

**Current Rate:** 1 USD = 1,457.42 KRW  
**Date:** February 9, 2026, 18:30 UTC

**Analysis:** The won remains relatively stable against the dollar at 1,457 per USD, providing a favorable environment for Korean exporters like Samsung and SK Hynix. This stability supports earnings repatriation and reduces currency hedging costs for multinational corporations.

### Bond Yields & Fixed Income

**US Treasury Yields:**

- 10-Year Note (^TNX): Data indicates stable to slightly lower yields
- Market pricing: 16% probability of 25bp Fed rate cut in March 2026 (per CME FedWatch)
- Next FOMC Meeting: March 18, 2026

**Analysis:** With inflation nowcasts at 2.4% for January (vs. 2.7% in December), the Fed appears on track toward its 2% target. However, with only 16% odds of a March cut, the market expects the Fed to remain patient. Kevin Warsh's nomination as next Fed Chair (pending confirmation) adds a layer of uncertainty around policy direction post-May 2026.

| **Industrials**            | +5.8%      | ⬆️ Economic optimism  |
| **Consumer Discretionary** | +3.2%      | ➡️ Neutral            |
| **Real Estate**            | +2.0%      | ➡️ Recovering         |
| **Healthcare**             | +1.6%      | ➡️ Lagging            |
| **Communication Services** | +0.4%      | ⚠️ Weak               |
| **Financials**             | -0.3%      | ⚠️ Slight negative    |
| **Utilities**              | -0.3%      | ⚠️ Rate sensitivity   |
| **Information Technology** | -1.3%      | 🔻 Underperforming    |

### Sector Rotation Insights

**Cyclical Outperformance:** Materials and Energy leading at +10% YTD reflects commodity strength and economic growth expectations. Crude oil up 11% and gold up 10% YTD support this thesis.

**Tech Underperformance:** Despite Monday's rally, Information Technology remains the worst-performing sector YTD at -1.3%. This divergence from strong Mag 7 fundamentals suggests:

1. Profit-taking after 2025's strong gains
2. Valuation concerns amid high multiples
3. AI capex ROI uncertainty
4. Sector rotation into value/cyclicals

**Defensive Positioning:** Consumer Staples (+6.6%) outperforming suggests investors maintaining some hedges despite risk-on sentiment.

## XII. Conclusion & Key Takeaways

### Summary of Market Session

Monday, February 9, 2026, delivered a **strong start to the week** with global markets broadly positive. Asian markets, particularly South Korea (+4.10%) and Japan (+3.89%), led gains. US markets showed mixed intraday performance with NASDAQ outperforming (+0.90%) while the Dow remained flat.

### Three Key Takeaways

1. **🟢 Semiconductor Renaissance:** Korean chip stocks (Samsung +4.92%, SK Hynix +5.72%) and NVIDIA (+3.24%) confirm the AI-driven semiconductor supercycle is accelerating. These remain core portfolio holdings.

2. **⚠️ Tech Bifurcation:** Within the Magnificent 7, clear winners (NVDA, MSFT, META up 2.7-3.2%) and losers (AAPL, GOOGL down 2.1-2.5%) emerge. Stock selection matters more than broad tech beta.

3. **🌍 Global Growth Broadening:** Materials and Energy leading sectors (+10% YTD), strong Asian performance, and small-cap participation suggest economic expansion beyond just mega-cap tech.

### Week Ahead Focus

- **Friday's Jobs Report:** Critical data for Fed policy outlook
- **Earnings Tsunami:** AMD, Alphabet, Amazon, Disney reporting - expect volatility
- **Technical Levels:** S&P 500 holding 6,797 support crucial
- **Kevin Warsh Hearings:** Fed Chair nomination process begins

### Final Outlook

Markets remain in a **constructive but volatile** phase. Strong fundamentals (earnings growth, AI monetization, global economic expansion) support higher prices, but elevated valuations, technical distribution, and policy uncertainty warrant selective positioning. Focus on quality growth at reasonable prices, maintain geographic diversification (especially Korean semiconductors), and prepare for near-term choppiness.

**Recommended Strategy:** Accumulate quality tech on pullbacks (MSFT, NVDA), maintain semiconductor exposure (Samsung, SK Hynix), rotate into cyclical strength (Materials, Energy), and preserve some defensive positioning (Consumer Staples, Gold).
